# Experiments with sample reduction for differential computation analysis

This repository contains experimental data and scripts to reproduce experiments with sample reduction techniques for differential computation analysis of whitebox crypto implementations.

The easiest way to run the experiments is the 'marvelsplus' Docker image from https://github.com/ikizhvatov/Orka. The image includes this repository and provides environment with all the necessary tools.

Alternatively, you can set up the environment manually. You need to have Julia with [Jlsca](https://github.com/Riscure/Jlsca), and [Daredevil](https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/Daredevil) on the path.
